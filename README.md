# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors
In this lab, you will create an interactable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

## Two versions

First version in this `.ipynb` file was working, but the `OpenCV` fonts were ugly.

So I created a second version (further down the notebook) which uses `Pillow` to allow display of a TrueType font. Much nicer.

The prediction is pretty reliable as long as lighting and background match those when the model was trained.
